# Java Basic Programs Repository

Welcome to the **Java Basic Programs Repository**! This repository is a curated collection of fundamental Java programs, organized to aid beginners in understanding and practicing core Java concepts.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Basics/**: Contains introductory programs covering variables, data types, and basic input/output operations.
- **Arrays/**: Demonstrates array declarations, initializations, traversals, and common operations.
- **Functions/**: Includes examples of method definitions, parameter passing, and return types.
- **Loops/**: Showcases the use of `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops in various scenarios.
- **Sortings/**: Implements basic sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- **Strings/**: Covers string manipulations, including concatenation, substring extraction, and character operations.
- **PatternPrinting/**: Features programs that print various patterns using loops, such as pyramids and triangles.
- **Recursion/**: Illustrates recursive approaches to problems like factorial calculation and Fibonacci series.:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

Each directory contains `.java` files that are self-contained and focus on specific topics or problems.
